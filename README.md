  Client case : Open Shop Film
</h1>

**A <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/" target="_blank">Hyper Island</a> Student Project**

**About:**

The Open Shop website is our first client collaboration at Hyper Island as a team of front-end developers and designers.

We were assigned a client, in this case, the newly-established film production company Open Shop, and we worked with them to develop their brand identity, design their new webpage, and build it from scratch.

**Design:**

We have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_blank"> normalized the data</a>

This above is how you add links into markdown.

_This is an emphasized statement, kinda like a disclaimer._

**Development:**

Write something about how we workded together here.

**Some of the challenges we faced:**

1. Managing client expectations, assessing the timeframe vs the scope of the project and making accurate estimates of which features were feasible.

2. Passing state between pages in Gatsby. In the end, we used cookies to store the data we needed to access across pages, but there are ways to do this within Gatsby that proved too hard to debug for now.

3. Our Node.js workflow file that we used to auto-deploy the site on push kept failing. We realised later that it was because it was trying to use SSH authentication, not possible on free organisation projects.

4. Integration with a headless CMS would have been nice, but time constraints meant we had to develop instructions for the client to update the site in GitHub instead.
