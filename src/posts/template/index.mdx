# This is how you write a heading in markdown

<br />

This is a post. Change the text. Change published: true to false if you don't want it to be displayed.

<br />
<br />

Copy a block to make a new paragraph, and replace this text.

<br />

<br />

This is how you write **bold** text. This is how you write _italic_ text.

<br />

This is how you embed an image in your post -- replace the link (https://...) with your image link.

![replace this text with a description of the image](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png 'Image caption goes here')

If you want to add a video, copy the following lines -- replace the link with the link to your video.

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen="true"
  >
    {' '}
  </iframe>
</figure>
